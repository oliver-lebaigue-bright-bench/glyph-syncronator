# glyph-syncronator - TODO list!

## To Do Fuckery

* rework the qs tiles, make one for glyph viz, one for haptic viz, and one for flashlight viz. enable of disable the service automatically based on if we have anything running or not.
  
* **and work on the translation tools so we can get hoomans to translate our app.**

* Remove brightness value text on the glyph brightness slider

* Make some gifs for the demos, not videos!

* Make the audio spectrum have the dynamic gain applied to it

* Last viewed screen should be kept in memory

* Check if auto update works

* ENHANCE THE FUCKING WIDGET

---

## Oliver's todo
* track audio source playing time, not audio_source_change
* Add multiples intensities to flashlight 
* Tapping back on the Viz preset editor should go to the prev screen., and tapping back should 
predictively go to the prev viewed screen tab before exiting the app.

---

## TODO
* track viz mode playing time (flashlight time, haptics time, glyphs time, these will be added up in the firebase charts if possible)

* ***Improve notification (ALEKS DOES IT)***

* glyph-syncronator redisigned settings expandable cards, with M3E BOUNCY ARROW

* Auto update mechanism without scary permissions

* Modify the glyph-syncronator liscence so only the owner can release, and everything that other developers do should be reported to the owner. And state that debug builds should never be released to the public because they are not meant to be used by the users, but only by the developers for developing purposes.

* enhance the built-in switches by adding an X (cross) or a done (✅) in them, like the battery guru's settings switches, and also with bouncy animations and nice haptics

* M3E split and round config update buttons

* Redesign about page for a proper hierarchical easy M3E design

* Merge Git repo link card with app version card

* Change audio page big texts (such as made by Oliver and rKyzen)

* Add rotary haptic motor mode

* parametric spectrum range preset for all phones

* update flashlight monitor with shape = audio, and other thing next to it = flashlight intensity.
  * make the shape flash to the flashlight brightness

* update haptic monitor with shape = audio, and line next to it = motor amplitude

* Do tablet UI

## Done!
* Remove haptic tab AND DISABLE ALL CODE RELATED TO IT if device doesn't have a haptic motor
* same for flashlight
* Remove notification detection
* Add disclaimer that this app uses Google Analytics
* Say that glyph-syncronator is DETERMINISTIC (add to readme)
* *(Low priority)* nothing styled widget with:
  * 3 buttons for source,
  * 3 for the Viz outputs,
  * 1 for start stop
  * 2 by 2 nothing style
* Make the auto latency toggle be in the latency card
* tweak tab switching speed arc
* collapse app theme setting section just like the experimental features
* put the typography selector under that app them section
* make the collapsed sections a bit bigger
* make the default theme have the nothing light theme when the device theme is light
* MAKE THE DEBUG APK BE IN GITHUB ACTIONS ARTIFACTS
* In the Material 3 expressive split button selector, when there are multiple rows, make the corner rounding of the 
edges only at the corner of the actual box of buttons. Multiple rows still look like it's something unified. And 
multiply the weight of the selected button by the UI shift variable.
* when the frequency range is large; they are less reactive for some reason. You don't need to divide the sum of the 
bins by the frequency range, the size of the frequency range. One of the causes is that the wide frequency ranges are 
less reactive than the narrow ones, which are usually the bass ones, so we can't really see the trebles.
* Collapse the live audio spectrum, and when it's collapsed, don't process it.
* Check if background is 0x000000 not if theme = default for the margin thing
* **RE ENABLE EDGE TO EDGE and FIX THE CLIPPING IN THE SIDE PADDINGS!**

* use the system navbar padding (fix it again)
* **Make the haptic amplitude mode resubmit a oneshot haptic all the time, even if it doesn't change!!!** currently it doesn't resubmit when the vibration amplitude doesn't change!
* make the oneshot duration slightly longer
* Remove idle breathing if device isn't a nothing phone
* Hide glyph tab if device is not a Nothing Phone AND DISABLE ALL CODE RELATED TO THE GLYPH UI
* Fix microphone latency
* decrease the decay for the android built in vizualiser (make the decay 60 fps even if the incoming data is 20fps)
* Add a disclaimer popup on first use of the media projection source that we do not record the screen, even if it looks like it.
* Track preset usage time instead
* Implement leaderboard and usage statistics

* Navigation Bar Overlay: Graphical bar visualizer on top of nav bar
* Dynamic Peak Normalization: Auto-Gain for quiet audio (Experimental)
* Battery Saver Threshold: Dims visualization when low battery (Experimental)
* Dynamic UI Theming: Use Palette API to match app colors with album art
* Use rotating rounded polygon for the haptic viz visual (boost rotate and change shape when beat detected)

* Add time count for the vizualizer
* Add time count for the visualizer
* Change title "About and other" to "App info and updates"
* remove latency compensation from microphone input
* Make categories for this Todo list.
* Ask Oliver if i can replace these checkmarks by some easier bullet points?
* Add flashlight visualizer (same UI as Haptics, add it at the bottom of the haptics screen for now)
* Collapse experimental features in settings tab for lighter UI
* Rename OLED black theme to "Default theme"
* Auto dark light theme for Nothing and Material You theme
